// Write a function, countPaths, that takes in a grid as an argument. In the 
// grid, 'X' represents walls and 'O' represents open spaces. You may only move 
// down or to the right and cannot pass through walls. The function should return 
// the number of ways possible to travel from the top-left corner of the grid to 
// the bottom-right corner.

const countPaths = (grid) => {

};

// const grid = [
//   ["O", "O"],
//   ["O", "O"],
// ];
// countPaths(grid); // -> 2
