// Write a function minChange that takes in an amount and an array of coins.The 
// function should return the minimum number of coins required to create the 
// amount.You may use each coin as many times as necessary.

// If it is not possible to create the amount, then return -1.



console.log(minChange(8, [1, 5, 4, 12])); // -> 2, because 4+4 is the minimum coins possible
